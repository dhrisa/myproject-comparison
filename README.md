# Learning github is nothing without git

## index.html and hello.txt are the file i made in my pc and i pushed these files to my github using these following codes:
 #### $ git remote add origin https://github.com/dhrisa/myproject-comparison.git - you will get this command after creating a respository and paste it in your git bash
 #### $ git remote -v
By the given code "$ git push -u origin master", the files are connected and pushed to your github account.
